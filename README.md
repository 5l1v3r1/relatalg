# relatalg

This package implements various [Relational Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) operations. It is mostly for learning purposes, but can also be used to test relational algebra equivalences empirically (i.e. by example). This is not intended to be a full-fledged database.
